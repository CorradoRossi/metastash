# Metastash

Metastash.xyz is home to a growing collection of projects under the Metastash umbrella including an experimental web3 app for viewing and interacting with NFT collections, the point of entry to the Metastash community and it's associated utility token **$STASH**.

Metastash.xyz is in early alpha and is a **WIP**! Most of the action takes place in the Metastash Discord server, which itself is an outgrowth of the Discord.art community and owes most of it's early success to folks from that crew. People who joined early and seeded the Metastash Discord were rewarded with the largest disbursements of **$STASH** and make up the core of the growing community.

The roadmap for Metastash includes transitioning to a DAO structure with **$STASH** operating as both a governance token and a tradeable ERC-20 coin. Proposals for capitalizing **$STASH** token at first include the creation of the Metastash vault, a collection of high value NFT's and digital collectibles.

Metastash is currently live (albeit in a very early form) and can be viewed at [metastash.xyz](https://metastash.xyz).
